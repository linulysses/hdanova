## Introduction

To do: 1) literature search, i.e., find out recent R packages on HD and functional ANOVA; 2) The new things in this package (CUDA, unified approach, etc)

## Simultaneous Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests

To do: describe methods for SCI (one-sample and multiple-sample): bootstrapping, GPF, etc

## Using the Package for High-dimensional ANOVA

To do: describe how to use the package

## Using the Package for Functional ANOVA

To do: define functional anova and hypothesis test on functional linear models; describe how to use the package

## Performance and Design

To do: some benchmarking with/without CUDA; discuss some design issues, etc.

## Conclusions
